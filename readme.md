# GG & kontornl Gimbal (GGKG) #

A gimbal camera based on Ai-Thinker ESP32-CAM using Arduino and madhephaestus/ESP32Servo library, modified from an example called CameraWebServer.

The following code indicates how to connect two 180-degree servos (for example, SG90) with ESP32-CAM board.

```
#define SERVO_PITCH 14
#define SERVO_YAW 15
```

This gimbal project may be useful and can't be simpler. It's for our enjoyment.
