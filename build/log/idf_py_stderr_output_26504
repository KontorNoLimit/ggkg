CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory C:/Users/knl/documents/PlatformIO/Projects/20220311_ggkg_esp32cam/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory c:/mnt/sdb/documents/PlatformIO/Projects/20220311_esp32cam_ggkg/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "C:/Users/knl/documents/PlatformIO/Projects/20220311_ggkg_esp32cam/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "C:/mnt/sdb/documents/PlatformIO/Projects/20220311_esp32cam_ggkg/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
